Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Uncertainty Quantification Group](https://uq.uh.edu/) at the University of Houston, advised by [Ruda Zhang](https://www.cive.uh.edu/faculty/zhang-ruda). 

My research focuses on developing data-driven technologies for resilient system designs and engineering applications. I specialize in optimization under uncertainty (Bayesian Optimization), probabilistic modeling (Gaussian Processes), and fully automated systems (Digital Twins). These areas align with the increasing use of GPU-accelerated supercomputing, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence to support robust design and intelligent decision-making.

When I am not immersed in research or developing mathematically sophisticated software, I enjoy church service, giving back to my community, exploring the venture capital space, listening to diplomatic speeches, and catching a good game of football.

===========
- PhD., University of Houston, May 2027*
