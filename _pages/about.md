Hello! I am a PhD Student in the [Beck Research Group](https://beck.cive.uh.edu/) at the University of Houston, advised by [Abigail L. Beck](https://www.cive.uh.edu/faculty/beck-abby). 

My research focuses on making decision-making tools more fair and reliable in the face of uncertainty. I build simulation-based models to help communities plan for disasters such as hurricanes. These tools not only predict outcomes but also surface who is most at risk. By combining techniques from probabilistic modeling, optimization, and equity analysis, I aim to support infrastructure decisions that are both technically sound and socially just. My work is rooted in real-world applications, from simulating power outages to evaluating which infrastructure investments most reduce harm for vulnerable groups.

When I’m not deep in research, I’m probably trying out a new dish, watching a great movie, or cheering on a football match. I like to stay active with Pilates, give back through community service, and unwind with a good novel.
